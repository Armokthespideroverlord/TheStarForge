  "description" : "[h1]Welcome to the Starforge expansion[/h1]\n\n[b]Before downloading the mod, I recommend you make a backup of your universe & player files, Starforge is a mod that adds a lot to your universe, monsters, dungeons, quests... Uninstalling it will corrupt some of your planets.[/b]\n\nThis mod is compatible with Frackin' Universe and every other mod you can think about.\n\n[u][h1] What is Starforge? [/h1][/u]\nStarforge is a Starbound endgame expansion, adding new & varied content while trying to stay as close to the vanilla style as possible. You will find the Thalasso outpost, full of friendly npcs who will provide you with new unique gear, around ~30 quests, missions, bosses and more! \n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/gfU6aDK.png[/img]\n\nThis teleporter will lead you to a new unique Outpost, where you will meet the crew of the Thalasso, a bunch of lively people who will provide you with quests & rewards! But most importantly, you will also find a [b]Starforge[/b], an extremely rare Ancient crafting station capable of making items more powerful than ever using [b]Ancient Essence[/b] and other rare materials\n\nMake use of your [b]Ancient Essence[/b] to craft high tier armor, weapons, and materials, and face the new threats looming on the horizon.\n\n[u][h1]New, rare loot monsters made their way into the universe                                           [/h1][/u]\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/DkKVFnL.png[/img]\n\nBut now, how do I use the Starforge? Well, once you visited the Thalasso Outpost and went underground to the Ancient Temple, you will find the crafting station laying there, waiting for you to use it. But at first you'll only be able to craft materials, in order to obtain blueprints you'll have to hunt rare loot monster scattered everywhere in the galaxy.\n\n• [b]Jootyfish[/b], found on [spoiler]Ocean[/spoiler] planets, floating around the sky.\n• [b]Roboblin[/b], found on [spoiler]Midnight[/spoiler] planets, roaming around the surface.\n• [b]Florant[/b], found on [spoiler]Jungle[/spoiler] planets, crawling in caves near the surface.\n• [b]Novalime[/b], found on [spoiler]Savannah[/spoiler] planets, bouncing around everywhere.\n• [b]Cacochius[/b], found on [spoiler]Moons[/spoiler], haunting the skies.\n• [b]Potlot[/b], found on [spoiler]Mutated[/spoiler] planets, hiding where it can.\n• [b]Warmonger drone[/b], found on [spoiler]Tundra[/spoiler] planets, patrolling the skies.\nAdditionally, you can rarely find all of them in [spoiler]Volcano & Scorched[/spoiler] planets.\n\nHunting them may reward you with blueprints to craft unique, endgame armors at the Starforge, each themed after a vanilla race!\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/sT8qWcw.png[/img]\n\n[u][h1]New threats and encounters                                                                                          [/h1][/u]\nBut Starforge isn't only about cool armors and unique weapons. Starforge brings new threats and encounters to the universe. From the [b]Yukai[/b], a Hylotl sub-species corrupted by their anger, to the [b]Unbound[/b], a new Apex faction aiming to evolve beyond the stars.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/nwjVGr3.png[/img]\nThe Unbound is the main antagonist of the Starforge mod, led by a mysterious leader, they are seeking the [b]Godforge[/b] to evolve beyond the star. They have access to a large variety of armors and ranged weapons, and will not hesitate to attack on sight. Encounter them on planets, fight them in missions, steal their precious resources, and slay their bosses.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/lHKNoto.png[/img]\nAs stated above, the Yukai is a Hylotl sub-species, instead of evolving towards the path of peace they vowed to never forgive what the Florans did to them. Shamans, warriors, the Yukai learned new techniques that could surprise you when facing them. They have unique armors, weapons, and structures that you can find primarily on Lava planets.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/ko47kjV.png[/img]\nThe Tide is an otherworldly plane of existence in which lies both beautiful and dangerous fauna & flora. Warped on planets by the Yukai hylotls, this mini-biome is full of unique items, monsters, encounters, and more!
