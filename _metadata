As of now, the mod is compatible with FU.\n\n[h1]About the mod[/h1]\n\nThe Starforge is a new Starbound expansion in the making, as of now the mod is just a pre-release version for you to try out and maybe give feedback on the current content. \n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/gfU6aDK.png[/img]\n\nThis teleporter will lead you to a new unique Outpost, where you will meet the crew of the Thalasso, a bunch of lively people who will provide you with quests & rewards! But most importantly, you will also find a [b]Starforge[/b], an extremely rare Ancient crafting station capable of making items more powerful than ever using [b]Ancient Essence[/b] and other rare materials. But in order to do so, you will need blueprints :\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/aCB9key.png[/img]\n[i](More monsters will be added in future updates)[/i]\n\nNew rare & unique monster made their ways into the universe! Hunt the :\n\n• [b]Jootyfish[/b], found on [spoiler]Ocean[/spoiler] planets, floating around the sky.\n• [b]Florant[/b], found on [spoiler]Jungle[/spoiler] planets, crawling in caves near the surface.\n• [b]Roboblin[/b], found on [spoiler]Midnight[/spoiler] planets, roaming around the surface.\nAdditionally, you can rarely find all of them in [spoiler]Volcano & Scorched[/spoiler] planets.\n\nHunting them may reward you with blueprints to craft unique, endgame armors at the Starforge!\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/AQVbRb5.png[/img]\n[i](More armors will be added in future updates)[/i]\n\nAs of right now, the mod adds :\n• 1 new outpost with a short introduction quest line\n• 15+ new objects for you to use\n• 3 new rare monsters\n• 3 new armor sets\n• 6 new unique weapons\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/DYiTU0V.png[/img]\n\n[h1]What to expect from the mod?[/h1]\n\nAs stated earlier, this mod is just in a pre-released version, things will change and get updated/polished as time goes on, but what can you expect exactly? \n\n• Mini-bosses that drop blueprints for unique weapons themed after each race.\n• More quests, related to the crew members & a main story plot.\n• Lore codexes of the crew and past events\n• an entirely new, endgame, enemy faction with micro-dungeons, dungeons, and even bosses!\nAnd much more that has yet to be revealed!\n\n[i](note: This is my first starbound mod, and also my very first time touching anything related to modding, it is very likely that errors will happen or that something won't feel very polished, I am also not a native English speakers so you may find a couple of grammar/spelling mistakes. Don't hesitate to report anything to me!)[/i]\n\n[h1] A big thanks to:[/h1]\n\n•[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070120146]Aegonian[/url] for allowing me to use his [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=850109963]Elithian Races Mod[/url] as a stepping stone to learn more!\n•[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/MoistCrevace]Nebulox[/url] for making all of the amazing unique weapons as well as the unique Floran armor!\n•[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/xraiizygame]Raiizy[/url] for spriting most of the ranged weapons and all of the Unbound faction weapons!\n•[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/AnomNum]Anomnum[/url] for helping me a LOT with tiled, allowing me to bring the Thalasso Outpost to life!\n•[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/nitrosteel]Nitrosteel [/url] for making the original sprite of the Principle of Duality unique rocket launcher!
