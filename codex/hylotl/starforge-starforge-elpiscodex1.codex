		"Elpis was first founded by the genius Hylotl Agni Chisaki on the moon of the same name, Elpis, which orbits the massive desert planet known as Pandora. Elpis is a silver moon filled with cold oceans. While any other person would've seen a desolate rock, Agni Chisaki saw an opportunity.",

		"Being a smart researcher in medicine, and coming from a rather wealthy family, Chisaki decided to found Elpis Medicine, a company studying the fundamental elements of the galaxy, being ice, poison, fire and electricity to mass produce Medpens and other medical supplies for the wounded of space.",

		"Reaching the adventurer & spacefarer markets first, Elpis Medicine quickly expanded its reach to most citizen of the galaxy. Combining affordable prices and quality products, Elpis has always aimed to be the perfect balance between quality and price.",

		"But today Elpis aims to become something more. Something bigger. With the recent fall of the protectorate, and subsequently the rise of the Unbound, we at Elpis think it is time for the company to evolve. From Elpis Medicine to Elpis Elements, we are now following into GAIA's steps and producing our own combat rifles parts.",

		"For every citizen of the galaxy, or every warrior, soldier or protector. We arm you with our newly developed Elpis combat rifle parts. We use our deep and advanced knowledge of elements to create cheap, but high-tech and reliable weapons. Protect yourself against the Unbound, protect your home against thieves, bandits or other dangers of the world.",

		"Elpis Elements hopes the galaxy can be at peace again, someday. Until then, make the world a better place."
