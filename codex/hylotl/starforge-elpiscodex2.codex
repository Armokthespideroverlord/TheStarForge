		"After other corporations decided to jump on GAIA's initiative to make combat rifle parts, we started to notice a significant increase in raids on our infrastructures all around the galaxy. After looking into it, some of our agents came back with interesting theories.",
		
		"Most agents think that this increase of raids is due to an increase in poverty, people are more inclined to join prolific bandit gangs to either sustain themselves, or seek protection against major factions such as the Unbound. While I find this unlikely, it is not out of the window.",
		
		"On the other hand, a particular group of agents specialised in spy missions looked into some of the other corporations that started to produce combat rifle parts. And they believe Xenotox is actively paying bandit and outlaw groups to raid our infrastructures specifically. They believe the manufacturer aims for the monopoly over poison-elemental weapons.",
		
		"This makes perfect sense to me, Xenotox is a company known to be quite aggressive against competitors on the same market, and ever since they started making weapon parts, we started getting attacked by bandits. Elpis is proud of its elemental knowledge, stopping our production of poison elemental weapons is clearly out of the question.",
		
		"The best course of action to take here is to increase the security of every Elpis facility. We should hire more people into our security branch and arm guards to protect our employees and facilities. We should also warn our workers to be warry of Xenotox spies and to be careful around suspicious individuals."
