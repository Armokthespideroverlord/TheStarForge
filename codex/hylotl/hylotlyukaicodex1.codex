"Generations ago, us Hylotls faced the biggest threat we could ever imagine. A threat so big we were on the brink of extinction. In order to survive, we fell in shame into the depths of the oceans, fleeing the Floran menace. But when most of us fell into despair, a single clan decided to rise and face that wave of extinction head on.",

"The Yukai, Hylotls who cherished their bonds and swordsmanship above all, lived on top of a massive mountain. Once the Florans came, they retreated deep into the mountain's cave systems and fought with everything they had. They're among the only Hylotls who successfully pushed back a Floran attack. But their victory came with a heavy price.",

"They spent weeks fighting off the Floran predators. For each Yukai warrior, there was at least 5 florans, and while they managed to push them off, they suffered great loss. Family, friends, home... So much was lost during that time, immense hatred just kept building up to the point of changing them forever.",

"Nowadays, Hylotl society refuse to consider the Yukai clan as part of the Hylotls, as years of evolution changed them to be fierce, aggressive and xenophobic. Through their struggles against the Florans, they developed means of fighting that are completely unique to them. From cursing their weapons to empower them, inflicting wounds that take way longer to heal, to contacting strange entities beyond our dimension for help.",

"As of today, the few Yukai families that took on the stars are usually located on planets with inhospitable environment such as frozen oceans or seas of magma, in order to stay isolated from other species."
