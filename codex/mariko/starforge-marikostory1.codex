"PART I - The Protectorate

I was studying at the Protectorate Acadamy in order to become a certified starship pilot. Exploring the galaxy and travelling around the stars was always something I dreamt of. This is where I met Krythers, a shy nerdy Hylotl raised by a Human family on Earth. He was studying chemistry, and despite our different interests we quickly became friends.",

"The Protectorate Academy was definitely not what I was expecting. Firstly, there was a LOT of people, finding a calm place for yourself was pretty hard. I often wished I didn't leave my home planet for Earth. But in the end, things turned out great. Until that one day when me and Krythers were heading towards the Protectorate Tower to attend the graduation ceremony. On our way we felt a strange tremor deep below us.",

"I don't think anyone was prepared to face that wave of devastation. Me and Krythers were just one year away from graduation, we didn't have access to proper gear so all that we could do was run. As a pilot student, I had access to a hangar that housed a few low-class ships. Usually you would need an authorisation for using one, but the massive destruction happening all around disabled most security terminals.",

"I honestly didn't expect us to reach space in one piece, but here we are. When exiting the atmosphere, the FTL drive overheated due to a stupid mistake I did and now we're lost in the middle of nowhere. My first day as a Captain did not go as I imagined. Drowning in the vast darkness of space, with only the dim light of a thousand stars guiding me, sounds like a fun adventure ahead of us."
