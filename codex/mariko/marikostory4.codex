"PART IV - The Rise of the Unbound

Something terrible is coming. I have to hurry and do something about it. Now that the Protectorate is gone, an Apex faction called the Unbound released a statement saying that they're planning to uplift the Apex race and ascend as gods using something they call a ^magenta;Godforge^reset;. They claimed the ownership of ALL ancient technology, isn't that crazy. They also declared war on anyone trying to stop them.",

"Truth is, we worked for the Unbound before. It was some time before they announced all this mess, mission consisted in recording the location of various Ancient ruins and transmitting it to them. It was then that we discovered our Starforge, Rondin recommended that we keep its existence a secret as it could become dangerous in the wrong hands. Seeing how aggressive they are acting and how much their equipement improved, I wouldn't be surprised if they had access to multiple Starforges. ",

"If they do, then surely they know the wonders you can make with it. I don't know how they learned of the existence of that ^magenta;Godforge^reset;, or what it does, but if they really want to fight every other race over it, it must be extremely important. I knew they were a bit fishy, but I can't believe it turned out like that. Without the Protectorate around, and seeing how pitiful the Peacekeepers are looking even now, I think the task of stopping them falls to us. They must be stopped.",

"I contacted a friend of mine I met when I was gathering informations regarding a bounty target. His name is Morpheus, he's an Apex specialised in information gathering and espionage. He infiltrated the Unbound for some time and managed to learn some crucial information. The one who leads the Unbound is named ^green;Apolleon^reset;, with the help of his three commander, ^green;Starvia^reset; the Rifter, ^green;Tremor^reset; the Fistguard and ^green;Silmar^reset; the Technomancer. ",

"The main reason they are looking for Ancient technology despite already having access to a Starforge is because they think they found a starmap that leads to the Godforge, but they don't understand how to use it yet. All is not lost yet, Morpheus joined the crew and will help us stop them, luckily we're not alone. Apexes who don't want to be part of his plans are already fighting, it's our turn to join the battle. We'll need more hands though, and I have an idea on who might be very helpful."
