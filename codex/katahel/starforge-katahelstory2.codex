"PART II - An army

\"For thousands of Cycles, this ... forge was waiting. My castle was built on top of that temple generations ago, hoping to understand it, to make use of its power. I've seen your creations, Rondin. You have potential, the potential to understand and use this ancient power. Help me seize it, and together we'll rule over all!\"",

"I knew he was at war against other Glitch kingdoms on the planet, but that was all I was told. I never expected these wars to be caused by him and his thirst for power. ",

"Thing is, backing out would lead to my death. Katahel showed me something that had to be kept secret and I couldn't refuse. So I agreed and worked under him. It took me a while before finally understanding what that forge was. A ^magenta;Starforge^reset;. An amazing station capable of making almost anything, it was hard to believe it even existed.",

"Katahel wanted a bigger army, but as time went on fewer soldiers were willing to fight for him. So I built him an army. I created the Robogres and the Roboblins using the forge- soldiers smart enough to obey orders, but not enough to defy them. With countless more soldiers at his disposal almost nothing could stand on Katahel's way. Except one lone Hylotl, crew captain and bounty hunter."
