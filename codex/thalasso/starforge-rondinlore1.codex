"RECORDING STARTED

^cornflowerblue;Mariko^reset;: You're sure you need to record all that? 
^orange;Rondin^reset;: Yes, starting now I will monitor closely everything that happens near the Starforge, you can't be too cautious.
^cornflowerblue;-^reset;: Alright then, I'm entrusting you with all this. Phew, feels good to finally be settled down here.
^orange;-^reset;:Yes, it does. Having access to both a Starforge and an Exalting Station will prove to be extremely useful for the things to come.",

"^cornflowerblue;-^reset;: I bet you're right. This place is so vast and yet so empty, it's kinda creepy. It better be useful if we're staying here. 
^orange;-^reset;: Trust me, it will. I can make all sorts of things here, almost anything. I'll try to make the place less scary.
^cornflowerblue;-^reset;: You got it! Add some lights, pretty colors and all that!
^orange;-^reset;: Mmhm, sure. I'll do what I can. There's something I wanted to try & make with the Starforge, might be a good start.",

"^cornflowerblue;-^reset;: I'm curious! What is it?
^orange;-^reset;: Keeping it a surprise for when you come back. What's your favorite animal again?
^cornflowerblue;-^reset;: I love jellyfishes. I find them beautiful and very relaxing. Why are you asking that now?
^orange;-^reset;: No reason in particular. You should go now, the others probably need help.
^cornflowerblue;-^reset;: Alright! See you soon Rondin.
^orange;-^reset;: See you soon.

END RECORDING"
