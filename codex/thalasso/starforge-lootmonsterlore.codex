"What are Loot Monsters ?

Well, it is a rather broad term, but we, the Thalasso crew usually call a monster, a \"loot monster\" when the creature holds or collects unusual loot. We have found many on our journey, and if you ever want to go on a hunt for specific items, this guide's for you.",

"The ^cornflowerblue;Jootyfish^reset;

The elusive Jootyfish is a strange, floating jellyfish found on ^cornflowerblue;Ocean^reset; planets, floating around the sky. They love to hold items in their \"belly\" and showing them off. There is a Hylotl tradition that consists in giving them precious items, hoping for them to last on forever, as Jootyfishes do not age.",

"The ^green;Florant^reset;

The Florant is a shy insect-like creature, often hiding and crawling in caves near the surface. They live on ^green;Jungle^reset; planets, where they make their nests out of leaves they pick up near the surface. They tend to confuse items for leaves sometimes, which ends up stuck in their big belly.",

"The ^orange;Roboblin^reset;

Now we have quite the strange fellows. The Roboblin are creations of ^green;Rondin^reset; back when he was working under a Glitch Warlord. They went rogue after the death of said Warlord, and now roam around the galaxy. They're common on ^indigo;Midnight^reset; planets. Watch out for their sharp daggers. They are sassy and love to steal items.",

"The ^pink;Novalime^reset;

This slime-like monster is very mysterious. They started popping up all around the galaxy a few years ago, they're mostly present on ^yellow;Savannah^reset; planets, bouncing around everywhere. While they are very similar to Novakids, I have no idea if they are related. One thing's for sure, they love to steal items laying around in their plasma-like bodies",

"The ^yellow;Cacochius^reset;

The Cacochius is an Erchius abomination haunting the skies of ^gray;Moons^reset;. I'm not sure about its origins, there are rumors of them being a failed experiment, summoned from another dimension but twisted by the Erchius. But they are just rumors, I cannot say whether they are right or wrong. They do not have a digestive system, so you can often find the belongings of previous, unfortunate adventurers or miners.",

"The ^red;Potlot^reset;

Ah, the Potlots, strange little creatures originating from the City of Commence. They are extremely curious, kleptomaniacs and would do anything to stock as many shiny items as possible. They share similarities with cats, meerkats and ferrets from Earth. They are often found on ^violet;Mutated^reset; planets, lured by the exotic colors of said planet. They spread all around the galaxy by hiding in ships, or people keeping them as pets, but accidently letting them escape.",

"The ^#80F4FF;WARMONGER Drone^reset;

This drone belonged to an Apex rebel group fighting against the Unbound known as the Warmongers. Sadly, they are nowhere to be found, and were probably taken down by the Unbound. These drones carry precious information and blueprints, and are all that's left of them. They're usually found aimlessly roaming the skies of ^gray;Tundra^reset; planets. They will not attack you at first sight, but be aware that they will riposte to attacks."
