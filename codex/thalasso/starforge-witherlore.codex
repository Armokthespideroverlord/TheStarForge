"My first encounter with the Great Withering, or the Wither for short, was back in the early days of the Thalasso, when we first met Strelitzia. Her planet was completely devastated, and corrupted by it. What it is exactly, I can't say for sure. Is it some sort of parasite? Or something else entirely? I have no idea. What is clear however, is that it can spread, and incredibly fast. It took over Streli's planet, and is probably spreading to other planets as well.",
"Where does it come from is also a mystery, not much is known about it. Some say it was a failed experiment, others that it was an old evil, sleeping on a remote planet, waiting to be awakened. While it doesn't look like a failed experiment to me, I cannot prove anything at the moment. Recently, the Great Withering has been spreading to a lot of systems, taking over an entire planet in a few months. It is becoming alarming.",
"What the Wither does however, we know. I witnessed it. To flesh, it makes it rot. If you get stung by one of the black splinters created by the Wither, a strange black substance will start seeping out of it and getting inside the wound, and if not treated immediatly, the flesh will start rotting. In approximately 3 days, the whole body will be inflicted. However, on plants and plant-based lifeforms, the Wither acts very differently.",
"Strelitzia told us about what the Wither did to her people, first, similarly to flesh, it will start withering the body or plant, and after a certain amount of time, which differs between specimens, the Wither takes over. By doing so, it also modifies the life forms, I assume it is to support and increase the spread. Strelitzia has a strange birth mutation which made her completely immune to the Great Withering, I am curious to see if she is the key to slow it down and eventually, stopping it for good.",
"There are rumors of people trying to venture on Withered planets, trying to get samples & salvage whatever is left. While I admire their courage, it is extremely dangerous, as the remaining creatures are completely twisted and deadly, not even mentionning the chances of spreading the Wither offworld. I'm not sure exactly what could start a Wither outbreak, is a bit of infected, rotten flesh enough? Or an infected plant? What about a small splinter? I am not sure, and too afraid to test anything here."
