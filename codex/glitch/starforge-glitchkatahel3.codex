"My dear lord,

Ever since the reports regarding the Outsider multiplied, our Master Crafter Rondin started behaving strangely. I suspect he is trying to contact the Outsider using a method unknown to us. While I have no proof regarding that, he seems to be spending twice as much time in his workshop than usual. I suggest you start monitoring him closely."
