"Today marks the beginning of my new life.

Me, Ronan & the others have discovered Ancient Ruins on this planet, and turns out they're built near large ore veins. We could make a lot of pixels with that! Build a new life! We told the rest of the group, and we're currently settling there. I think with time we'll finally live in peace. No more running away from the Stargazers.",

"It's been a month since we settled near the Ancient Ruins. We salvaged & sold most of it to make the constructions fees lighter. We still want to keep some traces of it as a reminder of this amazing discovery. Mining operations have started, we even gathered more Grounded people under our wing. We split up the village in two, some miners will stay near the site to make sure no one steal anything, while we will stay near the ruins. Things are going well.",

"More trading vessels are passing by to trade with us. I met a strange Novakid once, they wanted some titanium ore, but didn't have a single pixel. I was rather confused at first, but they proposed a quite amazing weapon in exchange of the ore. The weapon was broken, but if I could repair it, I could give it as a parting gift for my son, when he'll be big enough to leave the village & be on his own, exploring the galaxy. I accepted the offer.",

"I heard from some merchants that the Earth and the protectorate had been attacked and destroyed. I couldn't believe it at first, but after asking other passing vessels it seems like it's the truth. I don't know what happened, but I hope it doesn't reach our peaceful town. Just knowing that Earth was attacked and the Protectorate failed to protect it, what could we do if the same happened here?",

"I can't fix that damn gun I swear. It's been months since I've had my hands on it, and I still can't fix that energy cell. I tried to ask weaponsmiths that passed by our village once, but they couldn't do anything either. It seems like this weird Novakid made this weapon from scratch, and used unknown materials to make the energy cell. I have no idea how I could fix it, I'll leave it on display until I find a way",

"Recently there has been rumors of an Apex group rising after the fall of the Protectorate. I'm not sure but I think they call themselves the Unbound. Some traders warned us of them, said that they were looking for Ancient artefacts & relics of all kind, and that our small ruins may attract their attention. I'm not sure what to expect, there's barely anything left of the ruins at this point. What could they want there?",

"The rumors were true. They're here. I have to be quick, just heard firing shots outside. The Unbound came to our village, they were negotiating with the village leader moments ago. This can't be happening. I felt like this would happen, I hid in my workshop under my house. I don't know what to do. My family is up there. I have nothing else than them and this village. Why do they do this?",
