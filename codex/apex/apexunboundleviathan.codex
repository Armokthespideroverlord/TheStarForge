"Development progress regarding the \"Leviathan\" Heavy Tank. 
The first prototypes are completed and ready to operate on the field. We made a few ajustements on the caterpillars, making them more resistant to damage as well as changing the power distribution on the energy core. Their combat effectiveness is very impresive.",
"With these changes, the main weaknesses of the Leviathan are no more. We tested it against both vehicles & infantry, and the Leviathan proved to be extremely effective. After listening to suggestions from the Heavy Division, we loaded the vehicle with Thermite rockets and shells, our goal here is to melt the armoring of other vehicles.",
"With this, the Leviathan is a vehicle to be feared. Starvia is done with the manufacturing process, soon we will be able to face off even stronger opponents. Glory to the Unbound."
