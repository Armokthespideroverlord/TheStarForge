"RECORDING 045 // 081121

Greetings everyone. I am Starvia, current leader of the Science Division. I am calling you all here today to brief you on our most recent discoveries and ongoing projects. As you know, our main objective is the Godforge, it is our top priority. But after recent progress on a project, Apolleon allowed some... Side tracking.",

"Allow me to introduce you to the Rifter project. We discovered a rather... peculiar group of Hylotls, seemingly capable of \"summoning\" demons from other realm. I took interest in this. We studied their methods, carefully observing. And it turns out that, what they are doing is a primitive way of crossing worlds, and calling entities to them.",

"What does this mean? This mean that this realm, this world, is far more insignificant than what we thought. There could be hundreds, thousands, millions of other realms out there, just out of our grasp. This discovery is ... Amazing, really. The things we could learn is unimaginable.",

"So I will personally assign a team of some of you to follow me on this project. We will try to properly understand and use this technology, which in returns will grant us an edge in the near future. Crossing dimension? New universes? This opens many, many doors. Stay strong, for tomorrow will shine on us."
