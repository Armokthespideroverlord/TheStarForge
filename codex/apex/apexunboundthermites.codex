"We have finally perfected the development of Thermite Weaponry. Thermites rockets are ready to use by the Heavy Division, they produce enough heat to start melting most metals. We are still trying to make it so even Durasteel will melt, but for now Starvia deemed the current state satisfying.",
"While some vehicles might be resistant, the Thermite rocket will still heat up the interior of the vehicle making it almost unbearable to the pilots. Not even mentioning the damages inflicted to skin. The Science Division will then move on to the Experimental weaponry."
