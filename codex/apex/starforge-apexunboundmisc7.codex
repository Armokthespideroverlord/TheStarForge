"Hey Ma, hey Pa.

I hope you are doing well. I am writting to you from the ship again, looks like our operation will go on for several more weeks. We've traveled to so many planets it is amazing, I've seen worlds with glowing flora and glowing rocks, flowers taller than our old appartment, and so, so much more I can't wait to tell you about.",

"Sadly scouting operations are being extended for a few weeks, so I won't be back home for a while. But hey, at least we're free. Being able to travel like that, see how beautiful the universe is, you have no idea how happy that makes me. I have no doubt you are also treated well over there. The Unbound take good care of us. Even though, I wonder sometimes why we're extracting all this essence and all those artefacts.",

"I'm sure things will turn out okay for us. The Unbound is strong, and while our hands are not always clean, we're doing all this for our freedom. I'm very excited to see what Apolleon has in store for the future. 

Love you."
