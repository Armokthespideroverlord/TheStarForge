"My Dear, 

It has been 2 months since I joined the Unbound. They treat me well. I am paid, fed and even allowed to sleep in a proper bed. How long has it been since we were treated like this? I understand your concerns, and their methods are more than questionable, but the Unbound only want our good. Please, consider getting in one of their infrastructure for civilians. 

Love you."
